# HBC_Channels_COMSOL
Compilation of details related to the design of five (5) channel models used in studies.

Five communication paths were considered for this project. These pathways involved either in-body communication or in-body to on-body communications. These communication pathways were used to design channel models for FEM analysis using COMSOL Multiphysics 6.1. The surrounding organs and tissues affect the propagation of the signals through the body. Ideally, it would be useful to capture these effects, however, only sections of the human body were focused on to balance computational costs. Therefore, channel models considered all major organs and/or tissue structures between the transmitter electrodes and the receiver electrodes. The communication pathways are as followed: 

CM1	(Aorta to Chest): Pair of electrodes attached to the ascending aorta and left side of the chest. 

CM2	(Aorta to Heart):	Pair of electrodes attached to the ascending aorta and left ventricle. 

CM3	(Left Kidney to Back):	Pair of electrodes attached to the left kidney and lower back (left side). 

CM4	(Left Renal Vein to Back):	Pair of electrodes attached to the left renal vein and lower back (left side).

CM5	(Left Renal Vein to Kidney):	Pair of electrodes attached to the left renal vein and left kidney.
